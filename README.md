# <center>Problem Statement</center>

A Lesotho automobile company Thabure Autos aspires to expand operations and enter the South African auto market; so the company plans on setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to the already available counterparts in South Africa.

In their efforts to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends, Thabure Autos has contracted Deiv Data Consultancy (DDC), a data consulting firm. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the South African market, since those may be very different from the Lesotho market. So the company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car;
- How well those variables describe the price of a car 

Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large data set of different types of cars across the South African market.

## Project Goal
- To predict the price of cars using the available independent variables.

We could ask questions like:
 * What features affect the price of a car? 
     * Is it the color, the brand, or year of make?
     * Could it be the horsepower, or perhaps something else?

The model to predict the prices of cars will be used by management to understand exactly how prices vary with independent variables. 

With the model at hand, Thabure Autos can manipulate the design of the cars, their business strategies, and many more, to meet certain price levels. In addition, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new, foreign market.
